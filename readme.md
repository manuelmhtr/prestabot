## Getting the OTP Secret

1. Log into your Yotepresto account.
2. Go to Settings -> Security.
3. Under _"Selecciona tu segundo factor de autenticaci√≥n"_ (select your second authentication factor), select _"App de autenticaci√≥n"_ (Authentication app).
4. When the QR code is prompted, take a screenshot of it (only the QR code).
5. To go [XZing Decoder](https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx) or any other service to read a QR's content, and upload it. This will output a link like this: `otpauth://totp/YOTEPRESTO:user@example.com?secret=I3USKO0GA1BMHCIXY76QTQSU2AS6A2GI&issuer=YOTEPRESTO`.
6. Copy the parameter `secret` from the previous URL (`I3USKO0GA1BMHCIXY76QTQSU2AS6A2GI` in the example). **This is the value for the `OTP_SECRET` environment variable**.
7. Now, follow the regular process: scan the QR code with Google Authenticator, Authy or similar; generate a code and enter it in Yotepresto.
8. The second factor must be enabled and you are ready to go. For security, don't forget to **delete your QR code image**.

## FAQ

**Is it safe?**

Yes, the only known issue is: if you change your password manually or set the `PASSWORD` env variable wrong, the bot may lock your account after the 3rd login attempt. In that case, you'll need to unlock your account manually by opening a link you should have received by email.


**What happens if I enable _Autoinvest_ in my account along with this bot?**

_Autoinvest_ is the native "programmatic bot" provided by Yotepresto once your account reaches $20,000 mxn.

If it is active along with _Prestabot_, it may happen one of two things for requisitions that matches both filters for _Autoinvest_ AND _Prestabot_:

A. If _Autoinvest_ lends to a requisition first, _Prestabot_ will be aware and will skip it.
B. If _Prestabot_ lends to a requisition first, _Autoinvest_ **may lend to this requisition again**. So, you'll end up lending twice to some people.
